    React Router is a library that allows you to
    handle navigation between different components
    (pages) in a React application. It makes it
    possible to build Single Page Applications 
    (SPAs) where different views or pages can be 
    rendered based on the URL, without reloading 
    the entire page.


    route: Define which component to render for a given parh.
    link: Navigate between different routes without reloading the page.
    Dynamic Routing: Handle dynamic URLs(e.g., /user/id)
    Nested Routes: Handle routes inside other routes (subpages).
    Protected Routes: secure routes that are accessible only to authenticated users.

    npm install react-router-dom
